# RPCclient

The [Remote Procedure Call](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remote-procedure-call-rpc-in-operating-system/) (`RPC`) is a concept and, therefore, also a central tool to realize operational and work-sharing structures in networks and client-server architectures. The communication process via RPC includes passing parameters and the return of a function value.

## Basic Usage

```bash
rpcclient -U"" 10.129.14.128
Enter WORKGROUP\'s password:
rpcclient $>
```

The `rpcclient` offers us many different requests with which we can execute specific functions on the SMB server to get information. A complete list of all these functions can be found on the [man page](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html) of the rpcclient.

## Common Queries
