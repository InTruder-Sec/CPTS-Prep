## Pentesting Methodology

![Pentesting Process](0-PT-Process-IG.png)

| **Stage**                     | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `1. Pre-Engagement`           | The first step is to create all the necessary documents in the pre-engagement phase, discuss the assessment objectives, and clarify any questions.                                                                                                                                         |
| `2. Information Gathering`    | Once the pre-engagement activities are complete, we investigate the company's existing website we have been assigned to assess. We identify the technologies in use and learn how the web application functions.                                                                           |
| `3. Vulnerability Assessment` | With this information, we can look for known vulnerabilities and investigate questionable features that may allow for unintended actions.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `4. Exploitation`             | Once we have found potential vulnerabilities, we prepare our exploit code, tools, and environment and test the webserver for these potential vulnerabilities.                                                                                                                              |
| `5. Post-Exploitation`        | Once we have successfully exploited the target, we jump into information gathering and examine the webserver from the inside. If we find sensitive information during this stage, we try to escalate our privileges (depending on the system and configurations).                          |
| `6. Lateral Movement`         | If other servers and hosts in the internal network are in scope, we then try to move through the network and access other hosts and servers using the information we have gathered.                                                                                                        |
| `7. Proof-of-Concept`         | We create a proof-of-concept that proves that these vulnerabilities exist and potentially even automate the individual steps that trigger these vulnerabilities.                                                                                                                           |
| `8. Post-Engagement`          | Finally, the documentation is completed and presented to our client as a formal report deliverable. Afterward, we may hold a report walkthrough meeting to clarify anything about our testing or results and provide any needed support to personnel tasked with remediating our findings. |

| What is the objective of the Red Team Assessment? Are any activities (such as phishing or physical security attacks) out of scope?                |   |
| Is a separate Active Directory Security Assessment desired?                                                                                       |   |
| Will network testing be conducted from an anonymous user on the network or a standard domain user?                                                |   |
| Do we need to bypass Network Access Control (NAC)?                                                                                                |   |

## Common Privilege Escalation Techniques

1. Check for sudo commands via `sudo -l`
2. Check for `/user/.ssh/id_rsa` — if you have read access, you can get in as root

## File Transfer

### HTTP Server
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

### SCP
```bash
scp file user@host:/path
```

### Base64 Encoding
We can use a simple trick to [base64](https://linux.die.net/man/1/base64) encode the file into `base64` format, and then paste the `base64` string on the remote server and decode it.

```bash
# On source machine
base64 shell -w 0

# On target machine
echo <base64encoded> | base64 -d > shell
```
